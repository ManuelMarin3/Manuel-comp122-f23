# Today's Lecture Material
  1. Conversion Between Bases
       - Review and then Fractions
       - See slides: conversion-between-bases.pdf

  1. Base 10 to Base N: Whole Part
     
     - Pattern (table)

       |  number | / N -> | quotient | remainder | glyph |
       |---------|:------:|---------:|----------:|:-----:|
       |         | / N -> |          |           |       |         

       Answer:        (read glyph from bottom to the top)

     - Pattern (code block)

       ```response
       number = number    
           number   / N = quotient, remainder
           quotient / N = 

       answer:    (read remainders from bottom to the top)
       ```

     - Example:



  1. Base 10 to Base N: Fractional Part

     - Pattern (code block)
       ```response
          number = ddddd
          max =  1,00000
             number  * N = overflow, product
             product * N = 

          answer:    (read remainders from bottom to the top)
        ```

     - Example:  .456 to Base 2
       ```response
          number = 456
          max =  1,000
            456 * 2 = 0, 912
            912 * 2 = 1, 824
            824 * 2 = 1, 648
            648 * 2 = 1, 296

            296 * 2 = 0, 592
            592 * 2 = 1, 184
            184 * 2 = 0, 368
            368 * 2 = 0, 736

            736 * 2 = 1, 472
            472 * 2 =
        answer:  2# 0111 0100 1
        ```
  1. Code: Whole Part
     ```java
     static int whole2bin (int number) {


     }
     ```

  1. Code: Fractional Part
     ```java
     static int fractional2bin(int number, int precision) {
        int max;
        final int max_bits = 23;

        max = (int) Math.pow(10, precision);

        return 0;
     ```
     - notes:
       * the number is left justified
       * precision == num_digits(number);
